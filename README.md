# BankingApplication
This is an in depth prototype of a banking application. It has the ability to interact with the user to open and manage an account at this "bank". 
Users can open an account, get their account information and balance, change their PIN, deposit money into their account, transfer money between accounts, withdraw money from 
their account, withdraw money from the "ATM", deposit change, close an account, and calculate and add monthly interest to accounts. Written in Python, this application could be 
developed into a usable bank application. 

To run this application, simply download the program to your IDE and run. Enjoy!
